Python List Operations Project
Description
This project showcases various Python list operations, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding elements. It is a practical demonstration of how lists can be dynamically manipulated in Python.

Features
- Create and manage a dynamic list.
- Add single or multiple elements to the list.
- Sort the list and locate specific elements.

 Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your computer.
- A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code or PyCharm.

How to Run
1. Clone or download the project to your computer.
2. Save the Python script to your desired location.
3. Open the script in your preferred Python environment.
4. Run the script to see the list operations in action.

Steps Demonstrated in the Script
1. Create an empty list: `my_list`.
2. Append elements: `10, 20, 30, 40`.
3. Insert the value `15` at the second position.
4. Extend the list with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Remove the last element from the list.
6. Sort the list in ascending order.
7. Find and print the index of the value `30`.

Example Usage
Run the script and observe how the list evolves at each step. The final output will display the sorted list and the index of the value `30`.

Happy coding! Remember if it works dont touch it ðŸš€
